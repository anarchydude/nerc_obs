# nerc_obs
This is a tiny repo for our HTML/CSS for our OBS scenes. Won't see much action, but I wanted to get this versioned and somewhere outside of OBS.

## How to use
This is meant for web sources in OBS, that are calling against Robot Recon's stream-support back-end content. These pages are stripping down the live content to just the essentials, and allows me to add some CSS to make the text and images how I want them to appear.

That's not to say that my code isn't a good sample for someone else. CSS is CSS!
